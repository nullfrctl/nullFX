# Perceptual effects.
Unlike many [ReShade](https://reshade.me) shader repositories, nullFX is exclusively using perceptual color spaces.
That means, every effect, is using mathematics based on the human eye's perception.

This allows nullFX to be significantly different in both customizability and function.
